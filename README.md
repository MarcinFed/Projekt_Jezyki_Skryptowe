# Credit programme Scripting languages - Trip planning application

The travel planning application was developed as a credit project from the course 'Scripting Languages'. The project confronts the real problems of the lengthy trip 
planning process by making it easier by storing all the important information in one place.

### The app stores information such as:
* destination and length of the trip,
* means of transport used to get to and back from the trip,
* detailed plan for each day,
* forecasted or archived weather.

### The application also allows to:
* keep transport/attraction tickets,
* export the plan to a ".ics" file for import into the calendar (once the planning is complete),
* save unfinished plans for later editing.
